<p>Your credit history is the most crucial component of your credit score. This is the basis for calculating your score. Although it does take time, using the advice below is a fantastic place to start:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make all payments on time and avoid missed payments. Pay everything on time, whether it's your phone bill or your rent. Missed payments are worse than late payments but they do harm your credit score.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are no longer connected with an ex-partner financially, remove them from your credit history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use your credit responsibly and keep your credit utilisation low.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check your credit report regularly to ensure your details are correct (you can also sign up for free identity protection).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't apply for many credit products at once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to keep your credit card balances low.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're struggling with debt, you can work with debt advisors. They will help you work out agreements with your lenders and potentially avoid Country Court Judgements (CCJs).</p>
