<p>When it comes to applying for credit, a permanent address is typically needed and can increase your chances of being approved.</p>
<p>This can be done whether you are living alone, in shared accommodation or with your parents.</p>
<p>By confirming where you live &ndash; such as by registering on the electoral roll &ndash; you can prove to lenders that you live at your current address and ensure the information contained on your credit report is accurate and up to date.</p>
