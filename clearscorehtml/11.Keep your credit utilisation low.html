<p>Your credit utilisation is the percentage of credit you use and, by keeping it low, you can keep your credit score above a certain threshold.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a limit of &pound;3,000 and you&rsquo;ve used &pound;1,500, your credit utilisation will be 50%.</p>
<p>However, in order to reassure lenders that you can pay back credit, you should ideally keep your credit utilisation below 30% or 20% wherever possible.</p>
