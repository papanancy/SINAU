<p>Some of the key changes to the credit score bands from ClearScore include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is no longer a Very Poor credit rating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many people who were in the Poor band before are now in the Fair band</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Good band is now larger to allow more people to fall in this range</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Excellent band is divided into Very Good and Excellent so some people who were in the old Excellent band will now fall into the Very Good band</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's possible that you ended up in a different band. Your credit score has not decreased or increased as a result, it's only because of the new scale. For instance, a credit score of 278 before November 2021 was considered to be in the Very Poor ClearScore band.</p>
<p>The same 278 score is now in the Poor ClearScore band. The credit score remains unchanged. The name of the band that the score now belongs to is the only thing that has changed.</p>
<p>Some people found themselves in a lower band, but lenders don't see it any differently. Keep in mind that it's only the name of the band that changed, not your credit score.</p>
