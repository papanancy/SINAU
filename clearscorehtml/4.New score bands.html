<p>ClearScore has five score bands, from poor to exceptional. In November 2021, ClearScore score bands changed to comply with the April 2021 introduction of the new 1,000 Equifax credit score system. ClearScore now gives a score out of 1,000, up from its previous score of 700.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that your credit score is now higher than it was. This doesn't necessarily imply that your credit score has increased; rather, the new scale has resulted in a higher number.</p>
<p>Before April 2021, Equifax had a credit scale out of 700, divided as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Very poor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excellent</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since then, Equifax changed the scale to be out of 1,000 and also changed the ratings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Poor (0 - 438)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fair (439 - 530)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good (531 - 670)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very Good (671 - 810)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excellent(811 - 1,000)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing your credit scores is a great way of understanding how you can improve your credit rating. If you have a poor credit score, you can also work with a professional who specialises in debt review to help you improve your credit score and get your finances back on track.</p>
