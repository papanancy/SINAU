<p>A personal loan is money borrowed from a bank, credit union or other financial institution that is typically repaid in fixed payments over a set number of months. Though many loans can take days to hit your bank account, fast personal loans can deposit your money as early as the same day.</p>
<p>To get a fast personal loan, you typically need only to fill out an application online or over the phone. But it&rsquo;s generally best to shop around before applying. The&nbsp;best personal loans&nbsp;will usually offer lower interest rates and flexible repayment terms based on your creditworthiness. Knowing what you&rsquo;re eligible for upfront can protect you from instant cash offers that might seem attractive, but come with predatory loan terms that can make it difficult to repay the loan.</p>
