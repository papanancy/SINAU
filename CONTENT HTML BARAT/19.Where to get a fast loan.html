Personal loans are offered by banks, credit unions and online lenders, and each can have different approval and funding times.

Fast online loans
Online lenders let borrowers apply, receive money and make payments entirely online. The time from approval to receiving the funds can range from same-day to a few business days, depending on the lender.

Many online lenders offer the option to pre-qualify before applying to see prospective rates and terms without affecting your credit score. Some lenders may charge an origination fee that is deducted from your loan amount and adds to the cost of your loan.

Lenders like Discover and LightStream can be options for those with good or excellent credit (score of 690 or higher), while Upstart and Upgrade accept borrowers with fair or bad credit (score of 689 or lower).

Fast credit union loans
Some credit unions can fund personal loans quickly. Alliant Credit Union, for example, funds loans the same day, though you’ll need to be a member for 90 days before you apply.

Credit unions often have lower annual percentage rates, which can make it a cheaper option. An applicant's history as a member can inform loan decisions, so being in good standing with a credit union may help your application.

Fast bank loans
Banks offer personal loans, but funding may take up to a week. Some banks accept loan applications only from existing bank customers, and you may have to apply in person for a loan. Banks also tend to favor borrowers with strong credit scores.
