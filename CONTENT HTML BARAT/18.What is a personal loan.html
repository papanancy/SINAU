		<p>Personal loans are generally unsecured, which means they don't require collateral. Instead, lenders consider your credit, income and debt when determining if you qualify and your rate. Annual percentage rates on personal loans range from about 6% to 36%, with the best rates going to borrowers with strong credit. Loan amounts range from $1,000 to $100,000, and monthly payments are fixed for the loan term, typically two to seven years.

Consider rates and terms — in addition to funding time — when you compare fast personal loans from lenders.
