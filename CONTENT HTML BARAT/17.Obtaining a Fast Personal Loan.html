		<p>Before applying for a fast personal loan, you can use a payment calculator to see how the loan amount and repayment period can impact your budget. Next, it often helps to gather loan documents — like a valid state ID or proof of citizenship and recent pay stubs — ahead of time so lenders can verify your identity, residence and income.

Typically, applying is fairly simple. You can check your rates with a few lenders to compare offers. In most cases, you can prequalify with multiple lenders without impacting your credit score.

Pay attention to interest rates, your loan term and any fees that could come with taking out the loan, paying it off early or making late payments. Apply to the lender that makes the best offer. But before committing, double-check that the loan terms work for you. Finally, sign your documents and look out for your funds — often within one business day.

Here’s a quick recap of how to get a fast personal loan:

The Bottom Line
			<br/>
A fast personal loan can help you cover major, unexpected expenses often at lower interest rates than most credit cards, and you can often get your money on the same day you’re approved. But before you borrow, use a payment calculator to see how a personal loan fits into your budget. Then, shop around with reputable lenders to find the best offer for you.
			<br/>
			<br/>
Remember that lenders typically reserve the lowest interest rates for applicants with solid credit. If you have poor credit and don’t qualify for an affordable payment — or if there’s a chance you’ll have difficulty repaying the loan — a fast personal loan may not be the best option for you right now. Consider improving your credit before applying for a quick loan.
