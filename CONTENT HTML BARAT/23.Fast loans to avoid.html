		<p>Payday loans and high-interest installment loans are both options that offer quick funding but can make borrowing money expensive. Try to avoid fast loans with high interest rates whenever possible.
			<br/>
			<br/>
Payday loans are short-term loans that are repaid from your next paycheck. While funds can be obtained almost instantly, loans can carry an APR of nearly 400%. Payday loans are commonly offered for small amounts like $500 or less and should be considered as a last resort.
			<br/>
			<br/>
High-interest installment loans are repaid over a few weeks to months, which allows you more time to repay the loan when compared to a payday loan. However, interest rates can be more than 36%, the maximum rate that most consumer advocates consider affordable.
			<br/>
			<br/>
For example, a $1,000 loan with a six-month term and a 60% APR would cost $182 in interest and require a $197 monthly payment. The same loan with a 20% APR would cost $59 in interest. Itâ€™s best to avoid high-interest installment loans if possible, as high APRs can make it difficult to pay these loans off.
