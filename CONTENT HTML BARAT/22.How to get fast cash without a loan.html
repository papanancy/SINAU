		<p>Before you borrow — especially if the rate you pre-qualify for is high — see if you can delay the expense or find an interest-free cash source. NerdWallet recommends trying all these cheaper alternatives before taking a high-cost loan:
			<br/>
			<br/>
Get help from local financial assistance programs.
			<br/>
			<br/>
Use a cash advance app to borrow a small amount from your next paycheck.
			<br/>
			<br/>
Get a pawnshop loan secured by something you own.
			<br/>
			<br/>
Try other ways to earn money.
			<br/>
			<br/>
If you are comfortable with it, ask family and friends for a loan through lending circles or a loan agreement.
