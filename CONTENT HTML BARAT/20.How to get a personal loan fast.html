		<p>Here are steps you can take to help move a loan application along quickly:
			<br/>
			<br/>
Gather documentation: Know what you need to apply for the loan so the lender can easily verify your identity, income and other information. Lenders often say their ability to fund a loan quickly depends on borrowers’ responsiveness to requests for documentation.
			<br/>
			<br/>
Calculate estimated payments: Use a personal loan calculator to see how rates and loan terms affect monthly payments. Then, consider how the estimated monthly payment may impact your budget.
			<br/>
			<br/>
Pre-qualify and compare loans: Pre-qualifying for a personal loan helps lenders understand your creditworthiness and shows you how much you may qualify for. It doesn’t guarantee you a loan, but it can help you compare loan options without affecting your credit score. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
Apply: Depending on your lender, you can apply for a personal loan online or in person. Smaller banks and credit unions may request physical applications, while online lenders offer faster web-based applications. You can typically get a decision within a day after submitting all the necessary information. If approved, expect to receive funds in your bank account within a day or two.
