		<p>Some lenders offer fast loans for borrowers with bad credit (629 or lower credit score). If you have bad credit, a low debt-to-income ratio and proof of stable income can help you qualify.
			<br/>
			<br/>
Your credit score doesn't affect how long it takes for a lender to fund your loan, but your loan is likely to have a high APR, and you may not be approved for a large loan amount.
			<br/>
			<br/>
Though many online lenders can fund loans quickly, take the time to pre-qualify and compare bad-credit loans before borrowing. Choose a loan with a monthly payment that fits your budget and make a plan to repay the loan.
