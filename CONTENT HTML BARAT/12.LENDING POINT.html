Disclaimer
			<br/>
Applications submitted on this website may be funded by one of several lenders, including: FinWise Bank, a Utah-chartered bank, Member FDIC; Coastal Community Bank, Member FDIC; Midland States Bank, Member FDIC; and LendingPoint, a licensed lender in certain states. Loan approval is not guaranteed. Actual loan offers and loan amounts, terms and annual percentage rates ("APR") may vary based upon LendingPoint's proprietary scoring and underwriting system's review of your credit, financial condition, other factors, and supporting documents or information you provide. Origination or other fees up to 10% may apply depending upon your state of residence. Upon final underwriting approval to fund a loan, said funds are often sent via ACH the next non-holiday business day. Loans are offered from $2,000 to $36,500, at rates ranging from 7.99% to 35.99% APR, with terms from 24 to 72 months. Minimum loan amounts apply in Georgia, $3,500; Colorado, $3,001; and Hawaii, $2,000. For a well-qualified customer, a requested loan of $10,000 serviced by LendingPoint over a period of 48 months that has an APR of 26.59% with an origination fee of 10% may have a payment of $340.52 per month. (Actual terms and rate depend on credit history, income, and other factors.) The total amount due under the loan terms provided is $16,345.12 and the disbursal amount is $10,000. In the example provided, the total financed amount is increased to receive the full requested loan amount after the origination fee is deducted. The total amount due is the total amount of the loan you will have paid after you have made all payments as scheduled.
